Introduction:
---------------
Here what we mainly doing is problem solving 
what are four kinds of analytics.
1. Descriptive(What happened).EDA majorly analyzing the historical data.
2. Diagnostic(why something happend).

4. Precriptive(what has be to done).

How data is collected:
Data can be collected in two ways:
1. Primary Data source(which the data is own by the firm)(ex: datasources, data lakes).
2. Secondary Data source(owned outsourcing, we are giving data to third parties to collect the data). 
when client is giving the data it is called secondary data, because it was not our organization data.

ETL transformation:
After that
1. Null treatments
2. Bad data
3. Irrevalant and Irregular Data
4. Data Featuring
5. Data Modeling
6. Data cleaning
We can also create more data from the existing data, It is also a part of data analytics.
